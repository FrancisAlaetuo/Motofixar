            <p>
                To maximize the life and performance of your vehicle, here is a list of items you should 
                check depending on the time and season. Some of these parts of your vehicle should be 
                checked regularly, and others only in the long run. Be sure to follow your vehicle's 
                maintenance schedule and service interval record.
            </p>
            <p>
                Caring for your car and keeping it in proper running order takes a little bit of effort, 
                but you definitely don't have to be a mechanical whiz to keep your vehicle running well. 
                The biggest hurdle is being aware of what needs to be done—and how often—for optimal 
                vehicle upkeep. By knowing the basics about what your car needs, and when you should 
                perform routine car maintenance, you'll ensure that your car is in top-running condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an added bonus, if you can prove that your vehicle has been well maintained, you'll be 
                able to ask top dollar when it's time to resell it. And, of course, it's important to 
                remember that car maintenance costs, while not always cheap, can ultimately help you avoid 
                expensive repairs down the road.

        <div class="main-maintenance-hacks mt-5">
            <p class="mb-4">
                To make it easy to keep track of your car maintenance schedule, we've created a simple, 
                downloadable car maintenance checklist to help you keep on top of your automotive maintenance.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-4">SHORT TERM CHECK-UPS</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
                For proper vehicle maintenance, inspect the following:
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">OIL AND COOLANT LEVELS</h3>
            <p>
                Every month, or every few gas fill-ups and especially before any longer road trips, it's a good 
                idea to get under the hood of your car and inspect both the oil and coolant levels while the 
                engine is cool. Low levels of either can lead to engine problems if left unchecked. Refer to 
                your owner's manual to locate both on your specific vehicle.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">AIR FILTER</h3>
            <p>
                Your engine's air filter is what regulates the air that flows into your engine and helps keep 
                out debris and particulate. By making certain that your air filter is flowing properly, you can 
                improve your fuel efficiency, decrease your emissions, and help ensure the life of your engine. 
                This can be done easily at home, so check your owner's manual for instructions and how often it 
                needs to be changed.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">TIRE PRESSURE AND TREAD DEPTH</h3>
            <p>
                Since well-maintained tires are integral to a safe, fuel-efficient ride, make it a habit to 
                visually inspect your tires often. Check the pressure in your tires every month, and before long 
                trips or carrying extra load.  Don't forget the spare.  A tire pressure gauge will be needed to 
                check your tire pressure. Also, during the colder months, note that tire pressure drops one pound 
                with every 10 degree decrease in pressure. Your owner's manual will tell you how much air pressure 
                your tire needs. You can check your tread depth using the simple penny method.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">HEADLIGHTS, TURN SIGNALS, BRAKE, AND PARKING LIGHTS</h3>
            <p>
                It's important that the lights on your vehicle are properly functioning, but oftentimes it can be 
                easy item to overlook. Once a month, turn on your headlights when you're parked in front of a flat 
                surface and check that both headlights are working properly and well-positioned. Walk around your 
                car and visually inspect both turn signals and your parking lights. Have a friend stand behind the 
                car while you engage the brakes to be certain that your brake lights are functional.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">OIL & FILTER</h3>
            <p>
                The motor oil in your vehicle's engine serves a whole slew of functions: it lubricates the moving 
                parts, helps act as a sealant against debris, cools the engine, reduces wear and tear, and helps 
                prevent engine corrosion. Keeping it clean is vital for good engine health. Depending on your car 
                and what kind of oil you're using, you may need to change both the oil & oil filter as much as 
                every 3 months or 3000 miles. Many newer vehicles' owners' manuals will recommend changing your 
                oil less frequently - often in-between 5,000 and 10,000 miles. Check your vehicle owner's manual 
                and consult with a professional to be certain what is appropriate for your vehicle.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">ROTATE TIRES</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on your vehicle alignment, usage, and many other factors, the tread wear patterns on 
                your tires may vary between the front and back tires, or even from one side of the tread to the 
                other. Rotating your tires will help to extend the service life of your tires by more evenly 
                balancing the tread wear, and helping prevent noise and vibration problems
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">WAX VEHICLE</h3>
            <p>
                Making certain to wax your vehicle every six months after washing it won't just keep it shiny, 
                it'll also help to keep both the paint in good shape and reduce the chance of rust. Many 
                irritants such as dust, sand, and salt can build up and environmental factors like ozone and 
                ultraviolet light can cause microscopic damage, but waxing can help minimize this by forming a 
                protective seal to extend your paint's life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="long-term-maintenance mt-5">
            <h3 class="fs-4 mb-5">LONG TERM CHECK-UPS</h3>

            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">TRANSMISSION FLUID</h3>
            <p>
                Much like the oil in your engine, transmission fluid is a lubricant that helps keep all of the 
                moving parts inside of your transmission functioning properly. Whether you're driving an automatic 
                or manual transmission vehicle, it is essential that you have your transmission fluid checked and 
                changed when needed to avoid costly transmission damage or replacement. Follow the vehicle 
                manufacturer's recommendations.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">TRANSFER CASE FLUID</h3>
            <p>
                In four-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicles, the transfer case is what shifts power from the 
                transmission to the axles. You'll need to have the transfer case fluid checked according to the 
                vehicle manufacturer recommendations to make certain that it is properly filled and leak-free. 
                This will require you getting under the vehicle, so bringing it into a professional is recommended.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">INSPECT SHOCKS AND STRUTS</h3>
            <p>
                The shocks and struts on your car function to control the impact and rebound as your vehicle passes 
                over bumps in the road and are an essential part of your auto's steering system. They should be 
                inspected by a professional every 50,000 miles or bring your car in to the shop if you notice a 
                decrease in smoothness or loss of control when driving.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">COOLANT FLUID EXCHANGE</h3>
            <p>
                The radiator in your car is a vital component that helps keep your engine cool and functioning 
                properly. Having your coolant system flushed regularly will help get rid of contaminants that can 
                build up inside as well as ensure that your radiator is filled to a proper level. Check your vehicle 
                manufacturer's recommendation to find out how often your coolant should be exchanged,
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">SPARK PLUGS</h3>
            <p>
                The spark plugs in your engine ignite the gas and air mixture that ultimately powers your vehicle. 
                If your spark plugs aren't functioning properly, your engine will lose power and won't run at optimal 
                capacity. Have a professional check and replace any faulty spark plugs depending on vehicle mfr 
                recommendations or when you feel a decrease in your engine's power.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">SERPENTINE BELT</h3>
            <p>
                Although may seem like a simple piece of rubber, your vehicle's serpentine belt is essential to 
                keeping your car running by powering peripheral devices such as your alternator, power steering pump, 
                and air conditioner compressor. Visually inspect the belt to ensure that it is free of cracks or other 
                wear and tear.  Replace id damaged or according to your vehicle manufacture's recommendation.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">FRONT AND/OR REAR DIFFERENTIAL</h3>
            <p>
                The differentials are devices that split the torque—or power—from the engine and allow it to send power 
                to the tires. In front or rear-wheel drive vehicles, there is only one differential, but in 4-wheel and 
                all-wheel drive vehicles, there is both a front and rear differential, and possibly even a center 
                differential. Like many parts of your vehicle, the differentials need to be kept lubricated to ensure 
                proper functionality. Have a professional check and change fluid whenever your vehicle manufacturer 
                recommends it.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="seasonal-maintenance-hacks mt-5">
            <h3 class="fs-4">SEASONAL CHECK-UPS</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The needs of your vehicle can vary by season and driving conditions. Following are a few suggestions to 
                add to the notes section of your vehicle maintenance checklist:
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">REPLACE WINDSHIELD WIPERS</h3>
            <p>
                Windshield wipers need to be replaced about once every year, or whenever the effectiveness is 
                compromised. In winter months, it could also be a good idea to install winter wiper blades for 
                optimum performance. You should also pull your wipers away from the window when parked during the winter 
                to prevent ice buildup.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">BATTERY PERFORMANCE CHECK</h3>
            <p>
                Your car battery is one of the most important components for your vehicle to run. A car battery supplies 
                large amounts of electrical current for the starter, engine and other electronic accessories in the 
                vehicle. Extreme temperatures affect the performance of the battery so regular battery testing will 
                ensure that battery will perform when you need it to.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">CHANGE TIRES</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on where you live and the winter driving conditions you might encounter, you might want to 
                switch your tires in cold, snowy months to a winter/snow tire. When the temperature hovers at or below 
                freezing consistently, the tire compounds in non-winter tires hardens, decreasing traction and handling 
                performance while increasing braking distance. Winter tires are have tread patterns and compounds 
                designed to remain soft in the cold and provide grip in snow, slush, and icy driving conditions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-6 fw-bold">CHECK COOLANT LEVELS</h3>
            <p>
                It's also important to check your antifreeze levels in your radiator in winter months to keep your 
                radiator or engine components from freezing. A 50/50 mix of antifreeze to water is generally recommended, 
                but check your owner's manual or with a professional to be certain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sticking to a car maintenance schedule, and keeping good records of what you've done, can help extend 
                the life of your vehicle and protect you against breakdowns, expensive repairs, and other unwelcomed 
                surprises.
